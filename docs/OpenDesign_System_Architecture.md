# 🧠 Open Design — System Workflow Architecture

## 🏗️ Overview

**Open Design** is a cloud-based AI website designer IDE where users can **create, customize, and generate websites visually**.  
The platform integrates **AI-assisted design-to-code generation** and a **community-driven training system** — similar to a hybrid of **Figma + Canva + GitHub + AI code generation**.

## ⚙️ Core Components

| Layer | Subsystem | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend (Client)** | Designer Workspace | React-based visual editor and code IDE (Canvas + Code view) |
| **Backend (API Layer)** | REST / GraphQL API | Handles uploads, analysis requests, code generation, and user data |
| **AI Engine** | Design-to-Code Model | Analyzes uploaded media (image/video) and generates code |
| **Database Layer** | SQL + Vector DB | Stores user data, projects, designs, embeddings, and code snippets |
| **Training Pipeline** | Snippet Trainer | Uses verified community code samples to improve AI models |
| **File Storage** | Object Storage | Stores user uploads, project assets, and generated output |
| **Authentication & Access** | Auth Service | OAuth + JWT + role-based permissions for designers and admins |
| **Analytics & Monitoring** | Metrics + Logs | Tracks AI performance, user actions, and training accuracy |

## 🧭 End-to-End Workflow

### 1. User Interaction Layer
- User logs into **Open Design** (OAuth/JWT Auth).
- Navigates to the **design workspace**.
- Uploads an **image, video, or animation**.
- System sends the file to backend `/upload`.

### 2. Media Upload & Preprocessing
- Backend validates and stores file.
- Extracts frames, colors, typography, layout grids, and animation motion vectors.

### 3. AI Analysis Pipeline
- Uses **Visual Embedding Model (CLIP/ViT)** and **Layout Parser** to create a **Design AST**.
- Example:
```json
{
  "layout": [{ "type": "div", "class": "hero-section" }],
  "style": { "color": "#222", "font": "Poppins" },
  "animation": [{ "selector": ".hero", "type": "fade-in" }]
}
```

### 4. Code Generation Layer
- LLM Code Generator converts AST → HTML/CSS/JS/React components.
- Output: downloadable ZIP + live preview.

### 5. Live Preview & Editor
- Real-time editing via Monaco/VS Code API.
- Save/Export project to DB.

### 6. Community Code Repository
- Designers submit verified design snippets.
- Approved snippets used for training.

### 7. AI Model Training Pipeline
- Periodic retraining using community data.
- Fine-tunes models + updates RAG index.

### 8. Project Management System
- Stores user projects, assets, and AI generation metadata.

## 🔁 Data Flow Summary

1. Input → User upload  
2. Processing → AI extracts layout  
3. Generation → Code output  
4. Output → Preview + ZIP  
5. Feedback → User edits → retraining
